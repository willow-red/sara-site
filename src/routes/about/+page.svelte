			Hi, I'm Sara! I am a 4th year student at the University of Southern California.
		</p>
		<p>I entered university with no knowledge of what coding was. As a freshman, I took a class in computer simulations to fulfill a GE. After writing my first program in MatLab (Conway's Game of Life), I became enamored with the art of programming!
		</p>
		<p>The following semester, I decided to pursue a minor in computer programming, and have since continued to learn both in the classroom and independently.
		</p>
		<p>In addition to being a self-proclaimed developer, I am a multimedia artist! My two passions seem distinct in concept, but I strive to combine them in my projects to create something unique.</p>
		<p>With my knowledge of art, design, and code, I create digital products that are beautiful, inside and out. My main focuses are web development, ui, and product design.</p>
